Responsive Portfolio
required items:

A navbar
A responsive layout
Responsive images

These items remind me of the HTML assigenment from HWK1:
 it inculded a nav bar that allowed the user to jump from text to text
 the responsive layout is the bootstrap porition of the assignment, i believe. 
 the responsive images may also be a bootstrap thing, but I want to revist the float activities form the html segment of the activities as well. 

I need to begin by adding the bootstrap URL to my files, starting with index.html - the file I will use as my "home".
Then, link my index.html to the stylesheet.
Next, link the other documents to the index.html : contact and Portfolio
Repeat the link steps for contact and portfolio, adding the style sheet and linking to bootstrap

Found a navbar with search included in Bootstrap, lets give that a go.
 need to style navbar but I will comeback to that.

Found a contact form and added that to the contact.html document

Added a footer to each html document

need to play with css now probs - edited contact.html to center box and remove unnecessary input boxes
    adjusted Message box by adding a <div> and naming it form-controla

Adjust h1 headers

Portfolio images and formatting:
Activity 15 Instructor Layout has image files
Container holds
